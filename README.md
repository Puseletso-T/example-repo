Responsive Periodic Table

This project is a responsive web-based periodic table of elements built using HTML and CSS (Grid and Flexbox layouts).

The design adapts to different screen sizes to maintain usability and readability across devices.
On large screens, the periodic table is displayed in its structured form using CSS Grid.On smaller screens, the layout shifts to a flex-based vertical format for better readability. If the table structure becomes unusable at very small screen widths, it is replaced by an image of the periodic table.

The project also includes breakpoints that trigger changes in styling (such as font sizes and layout adjustments), creating a seamless responsive design.
